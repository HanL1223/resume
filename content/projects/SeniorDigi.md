## Description
As the final project of my Master Degree, this website is to tackle the topic of digital poverty by applying various functions. I mainly take part in the avoidng scam function where I adapt the transfer learning method, using a fine-tuned BERT model to predict the likelihood of a text message received by a senior is a scam or not

To add more content to the result, I also displayed the words that has the highest attention score to help our target audiences understand how the result is driven from, and a D3.js based visulization tool to support the understanding.

## Key Takeaways
- Combining DS skill to a real project. Experience on merging model develpment with backend(Django) and frontend(React).
- Collaborative Development. Experience a full-stack project development with a team,and using Github for version control in a team setting
- Agile Management. Here I also exposed to the full agile software development cycle of a product
- Cloud Computing. In-depth knowledge and hands on experience on both AWS(EC2,Route52,S3) and Azure (Machine Learning Studio,Virtual machines)
- New Domain knowledge. First time expose to developing a product in a more public domain setting
